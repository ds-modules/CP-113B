","My main point in taking this specific photo is what it shows about the neighborhood, it is clearly a youth’s bike whether young 20s or a middle schooler. However, the importance comes with how the person left the bike. The bike was chained to the post with a fancier chain than the ordinary $5 one from Walmart which indicated a certain amount of wealth. The helmet was simply clipped to the side and things were left in the basket which implies a certain amount of trust in the area. I never saw the owner come back for her bike and even otherwise I wouldn’t be able to guess if she was a resident nearby. However, the bike itself was very indicative.

It is very well maintained with trees on either sides and most importantly no trash of any kind. The fence on the right as well is both functional as a barrier but also decorartive as it looks very well maintained and adds to the aethstic of the property. ,"This image shoes the well maintained street as well how organized and well taken of everything is. All cars are parked amply far from the street and the trash is in its designated position. The building on the other side of the street also sets the stage for the rest of the houses on the street, looking grandiose. ","The reason I chose this image is because of the importance of cleanliness of the people living on this street. Looking at the entrance to the garage, although there are leaves in the driveway the sidewalk remains completly clear. It really seems as thought the citizens of this street treat cleaninless as a top priority. Also it is important to notice the lights along the street as they do not look cheap and must be quite expensive to maintain. ",,,2018-10-24 16:57:59,,4214.0
