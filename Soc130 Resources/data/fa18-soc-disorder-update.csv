This makes me think that the city puts an emphasis on more ecological means of transportation. They city is also likely able to do this because they have the funds for it, and considering that there are several markets, schools, and convenience stores in this residential area, everything residence need is within biking distance, which is probably why the city (as well as its residents who are involved in city management and likely want to use/advocate for these biking lanes) cares to even do this.

It is made from stone with the street name engraved at the top under a statue of a sphere. This work of art, especially just for a street sign, is not common among impoverished neighborhoods, where street signs may not even be present. This street sign is symbolic of the wealth of the city and its citizens, denoting that they have the capital to build such an aesthetic monument for such an ""average"" object.  ","Across the street is a gas station, near the hub of the city. Unless most other gas stations in impoverished neighborhoods, this gas station is very well kept, not always super busy, and has seen some renovations in the past (I know because I used to stop there when I was younger). The business is obviously investing money into this specific station, likely to please their affluent customers/maintain the image of the area. The price of gas is fairly high. ","Next to the Public Library, there is a park consisting of a big grass field and trees. The area looks very well maintained (Thick bright green grass and green flourishing trees) as apposed to parks I have seen in the inner city that are mostly dirt and dark green weeds. I saw many children who seemed to be a part of the after school program playing in the park with some adults. I could tell the staff and volunteers are very involved in the programs, and that the library is thriving. The park, as well as the surrounding area, was clean of all trash, even loose leaves. ","One of the biggest observations to be made was of the housing. The houses were significantly well kept, in terms of the house itself and the gardening/driveways. These houses probably go for $700,000 and up. You could tell it was a wealthy community. I didn't see much people, but the area was only somewhat diverse.

","My main point in taking this specific photo is what it shows about the neighborhood, it is clearly a youth’s bike whether young 20s or a middle schooler. However, the importance comes with how the person left the bike. The bike was chained to the post with a fancier chain than the ordinary $5 one from Walmart which indicated a certain amount of wealth. The helmet was simply clipped to the side and things were left in the basket which implies a certain amount of trust in the area. I never saw the owner come back for her bike and even otherwise I wouldn’t be able to guess if she was a resident nearby. However, the bike itself was very indicative.
","This is a photo of the picture painted on the side of the bowling alley and while it was not on my block face, it was very clearly visible standing on the block face and looking across the street to the Bowling Alley on San Pablo, I found it interesting the statement that the owners and potentially the area is trying to make with the emphasis of “ since 2003”.

My city back home has a movie theater that has been around since the 20s, what it attempts to do is to take the current commercialization and add nostalgia which has economic and class implications in a comericalized, developed area.
